The following are error codes returned by the Atmel class
=========================================================

* RuntimeException

This exception list applies to the Atmel class V1.3.0

Code:       Description:
01          Invalid Instruction
            The AVR has read and tried to decode an instruction
            but couldn't determine what to do with it.

02          Program Counter exceeds upper program memory limit
            The AVR has executed the last instruction in program memory
            and doesn't know where to fetch it's next instruction from.

03          (DEPRECATED) Failed to load operations
            The AVR has failed to load and parse the "operations.xml" file.
            This error has been deprecated as of Atmel 1.1.0

04          Invalid Stack Pointer - LO XXX
            The AVR stack pointer is heading down into the I/O registers.
            You're probably try to push too much junk onto the stack!

05          Invalid Stack Pointer - HI XXX
            The AVR stack pointer is trying to go beyond the available
            data memory space.  You may have a buggy loop that is trying to
            POP too much stuff off the stack.

06          File not found XXX
            The AVR is attempting to load a hex or a binary file that
            has the small problem of not existing or is inaccessible.

07          Out of memory
            You are attempting to load a program that is too big to fit
            in the AVR's program memory.

08          Invalid file not Intel hex format
            You are attempting to load a very strange .hex file into Vince and he
            isn't awfully fond of it.  If the .hex file is a genuine one, you might
            want to forward it to us so we can fix Vince!

09          Invalid Hardware Stack Pointer
            The hardware stack pointer has gone awol.  Check to make sure your code
            doesn't have an unmatched push/pop somewhere!

10          Invalid General Register Number
            Vince has attempted to set the value in an internal register that doesn't
            exist.  The most likely cause is bad code.  If the code was compiled by
            a reputable assembler (I.E:  avra etc) then this is a serious bug that needs
            to be reported!

11          Invalid IO Register Number
            Ditto for error 10, only this is an IO register rather than a general purpose
            one.

100         Break mode encountered
            The AVR has executed a BREAK command and program execution has been
            suspended
